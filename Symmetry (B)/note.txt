I gave up being SDK-indepandent when it came to implementing the huge C_BaseEntity class.

It wouldn't have been too bad if it didn't have hundreds of references to functions, classes and structures
from other files in the SDK.

Perhaps sometime in the future I may go indepandant again, but until then Symmetry will use the SDK.
